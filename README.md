<h1>Features</h1><br>

<h2>Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion</h2><br>
You can easily convert your text to uppercase or lowercase using the provided buttons. Simply enter the desired text in the input field and click either the "Uppercase" or "Lowercase" button to see the converted text.

<h2>Copy Text</h2><br>
If you need to copy the text, you can use the "Copy Text" button. Clicking on it will automatically copy the current text in the input field to your clipboard, ready to be pasted wherever you need it.

<h2>Remove Extra Spaces</h2><br>
This feature allows you to remove extra spaces from your text. It can come in handy when you have excessive spaces between words or paragraphs. Enter your text in the input field and click the "Remove Extra Spaces" button to remove any extra spaces.

<h2>Hash Text</h2><br>
To hash your text, click the "Hash Text" button. This feature converts your text into a hash value using a cryptographic hashing algorithm. It can be useful for data integrity checks or when you need to store sensitive information securely.

<h2>Remove Symbols</h2><br>
If you want to remove symbols from your text, click the "Remove Symbols" button. This feature will remove any non-alphanumeric characters from your input text, leaving only letters and numbers.

<h2>Extract Numbers</h2><br>
The "Extract Numbers" feature allows you to extract numbers from your text. If you have a string containing various characters and want to isolate the numbers within it, click the "Extract Numbers" button. The app will extract all numerical values and display them in the output field.

<h2>Read Text</h2><br>
If you prefer to listen to your text rather than reading it, you can use the "Read Text" feature. Clicking on the "Read Text" button will activate text-to-speech functionality, and the app will read aloud the text entered in the input field.
